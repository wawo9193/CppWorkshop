What are two different command-line based text editors (text editors that run from the command line and do not open a separate application)? 
(Answer the following questions for each editor that you have chosen.)

sublime, emacs, vim, and... vscode!

vim filename.ext

What command do you use to save a file while using this editor?

press 'esc' and type command, :w

What command do you use to exit this editor?

press 'esc' and type command, :q

to concatenate both save/quit commands, press 'esc' and type command, :wq

What are two reasons you might want to use the text editors listed above?

Text editors are very lightweight so they are quick to get up and running.

They are also very simple, so it is not overcrowded with tools to learn and allow
you to learn the barebones commands that can allow control of text and code.

Also, vim is very prevalent on linux/unix and is very stable.
